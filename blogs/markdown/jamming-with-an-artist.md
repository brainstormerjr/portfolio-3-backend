So, another blog. It has been like 3 months since I wrote one of these.

I participated in the GMTK Game Jam 2022 on 16th July 2022, which lasted 2 days. That was like a month ago, so why am I only writing a blog about it now? No fucking clue. I only uploaded the project page today, so might as well write a blog about the experience, right?

This is the first time I worked together with a legitamate professional artist, and it was WILD. If you paid attention to my work before, you would have noticed the shitty cartoon characters in my games. Although they have some 'style', it is nothing compared to actual work done by people who devoted their lives to creating good quality artwork.

This is the spritesheet for the player character in this game. You may like it,or you might prefer my art style over this, but you have to admit it is a nice change of pace to see something that ISN'T straight out of fucking cartoon network moving around on screen. This spritesheet did take almost a full day (out of the 2-day deadline) to get to me, and I wish I could blame the artist for everything but honestly I think it's my bad that I didn't tell her I could just mirror the sprite in code. So you know, I guess we can split the blame 50/50 on this one.

In the end, we managed to submit the project by the deadline, even though we had to stay up 'till 3:00am to finish up. I also had a game testing guy that tested my game wayyyyyy too much to make sure it was fun and balanced, which was nice. So almost a team of THREE. Three times more people than I am used to working with. But it was a fun experience, and honestly things went wayyyyyy more smoothly than I anticipated.

This is the title screen of the game. Tell me this doesnt look SICK. It also has parallax, and the crossbow moves when your cursor moves around the screen. One of the best looking title screens I have ever put in a game, hands down. All thanks to the great art supplied by the artist, the tools given to me by the Unity engine, and my big ass brain.

You know what I wasn't too happy about though? The game itself. It just felt off. I don't know what it is, but it feels less polished than my other game jam entries, even though I spent quite a bit of time polishing this one. The mechanics and gameplay just feels... off? I might be overthinking it though, because other people liked it just fine. Maybe it's the inner game design perfectionist talking.

Overall? A great game jam experience. I look forward to doing another one in a few weeks, maybe with the same team. If they are down for it.
