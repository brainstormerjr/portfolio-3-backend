It's time to create a portfolio for myself. No reason why. Just wanna do it, I guess. Maybe because having a convenient place to see all my projects would be nice. Maybe I want to show off. Maybe this is just a way to distract myself from the pain within that consumes me more and more each day. Maybe it's just cool. Nobody knows why we do anything. That's the beauty of creativity.

This portfolio is my first ever full-scale project with Vue.js. It is a GREAT experience, and it allows me to do SO MUCH MORE with so little effort. I guess I will never go back to vanilla javascript (unless it's for a P5 project because why bother setting up so much for a small sketch). This is like Wix/Weebly, but more computer science-ey, if you know what I mean. And I love being computer science-ey. I love spending hours in front of my computer, debugging a heap of messy and illegible code. It's fun.

Now let's address the elephant in the room. I am great with making projects. They are AWESOME to work on. I have a million tiny experiments just sitting on my computer. These projects just don't get boring. And because I make so many projects, I would say I am at least decent at them. However, as you can tell by the obvious lack of effort in the cover image of this blog, I suck ASS at writing blogs (and writing in general). Sure, me don't make a many grammar mistake, but I am still not great at writing interesting content. The greatest writing achievement I have is getting you to read more than 3 paragraphs of this blog.

So why am I writing a blog? Because blogs are cool I guess? There is just no reason to not include a blog in my own PERSONAL WEBSITE. But I have no idea how to setup a decent blog either. This is written in VS Code in a .json format, and it is not exactly enjoyable to write. But what else am I supposed to do? I am a programmer, not a journalist. Maybe one day these blogs will be written in a software that doesn't use a monospace font. A blog written in a format that doesn't require me to write an entire paragrah in one line just so that it will parse properly.

Did you look at the above picture closely? If not, look again. Right there at the bottom of the editor. Do you see it? It's a key in this blog json file called 'links'. Now you may be wondering: where the hell are my links? There is not a single link mentioned in this blog. Are you scamming me, Harold? What are you trying to pull? And to that, I respond: I have no f\*cking clue.

Ok, that may be a slight exaggeration. I do kind of know why I might need links for the future: so that my blogs can be slightly more interesting by linking to other stuff. However, I have absolutely no clue why I put links in this particular blog. There is no need for a link. Absolutely none. However, as of writing this, this is the only blog on this foresaken website so I will need to test out the links functionality, so go ahead! Scroll down to the links and click on them! Don't let my efforts be in vain! Don't worry, all the links open in new tabs so you can always just come back. I'll be waiting ;)

That was a LONG detour on how terrible I am at writing blogs. Now let's get to the actual topic promised in the title: CREATING A PORTFOLIO:

I just learned Vue. Quite literally just a week ago. And a week later I already have a pretty solid website. Just in case the website looks EXTRA CRISPY in the future, I will put an image below to depict what the website looks about 1 week into development:

That page is the project page. That may look different depending on when in the future you are reading this from (and if you are part of an alien civilization, welcome to Earth). I just want a place to see all the things that I have done, especially when I am old and grey and sitting on a bed. I want to be able to go to that website and click through all the stupid sh\*t that I made over the years, and go 'oh yeah I remember making that!'. And also a great way for future employers to see what I do I guess.

I wish there was more to say about my portfolio. But there really isn't much. Check out the 'about' page, I guess. It says that I am a horny teenager there, which is kinda funny? I don't know. Oh well.

See ya!
