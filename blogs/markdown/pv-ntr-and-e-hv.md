A rant dedicated to the guy who sits next to me in physics. And other idiots in science. (Warning: long and boring heap of text ahead)

Everyone knows the ideal gas equation (if you do high school physics or chemistry). pV=nRT. That is how everyone learnt it. At least that is what I thought. Then one day, this guy tells me that it is pV=nTR. nTR. Temperature is put before the molar gas constant. Why. Just, why.

I know what you are thinking. 'It's just an equation!' And it is. But every single time I hear it, it hurts. Every time I hear it, I die a little inside. And I hear it too much. Every single time we do anything related to ideal gases, he says 'pV=nTR HAHAH AHAHAHAH AHHAAH HAHAHAHA'. And my ears are subject to the indescribable torment once again. I wait for the thought of this abomination of an equation to leave my mind. But it doesn't seem to go.

I know that it sounds like he is just saying that to piss me off. But I asked him about it. Turns out has has used pV=nTR instead of pV=nRT his entire life. His entire life. This is unacceptable. Which is why I might start a fund to help the mentally challenged get their physics equations right.

Then there is the other question: should you use uppercase P or lowercase p for pressure? The thing is, both are already used for something: P for power and p for momentum (strangely there is no p in momentum). If only there was a 3rd version of the letter 'p', then maybe pressure can use that. I prefer lower case p, beacause well... reasons. But if you use upper case P I won't judge.

Enough about pV=nTR, we will circle back. Let's talk about other stupid stuff in science (because I like to), like the use of the greek letter ùúà (nu) for frequency of light instead of the obvious choice of the latin letter f. I know f is still used, and definitely the one I use, but some people use ùúà for some reason. I mean, just look at this equation: E=hf. So clear and concise. So easily understandable. Then look at this abomination: E=hùúà. What does ùúà stand for? It's not a latin letter v since it is curly, so not velocity. How would I know that ùúà stands for FREQUENCY? Its frequency, not vrequency, and definitely not ùúàrequency.

What other stupid things are there in science? Well let's talk about our lowercase and uppercase P's again. We have power (P), momentum (p), and pressure (P / p). But what about density? The symbol for density is the greek letter œÅ (rho). I don't know about you, but that looks awfully like a p to me. So let's say we created a new property of a material. It is the momentum gained when a certain pressure is applied at an indicated power to an object of a particular density (it doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense, we are just theorizing here). Let's give this unknown property the symbol P. The expression for this property would be:

P = pPpœÅ

Now I know, this property doesn't even make any sense. But something similar to this MIGHT happen in the future. What will the world of physics do if/when it does? Are we just going to allow this? This is a gaping flaw in the system. And it needs to be fixed.

So here is the solution: we don't use single symbols. They are ambiguous and are kinda up to interpretation. Instead of saying pV=nRT, we should say 'pressure times volume equals the number of moles of gas times the molar gas constant times the temperature of the gas.' I'll admit, that is quite a mouthful. But it is for the best. After all, there is no abmiguity, right?

If you have ever tried to describe a mathematical equation over the phone, you know what I'm about to say. Imagine you are trying to tell someone this suvat equation: s = 0.5(u + v)t. What would you say? You could say 'displacement equals a half times initial velocity plus final velocity times time.' But that isn't really clear. For all I know, you could be saying s = 0.5u + vt, which isn't quite what you were actually trying to say. And also we all know this is a stupid solution.

So I guess there is no way out.

There is no solution to this mess.

We just gotta suck it up I guess. T_T
