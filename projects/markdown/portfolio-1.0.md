# Summary
The original Harold Kwan portfolio, made back in 2022 with Vue and SASS. I thought I would maintain it, but late 2023 Harold deemed it too ugly and rebuilt it using SvelteKit, resulting in [Portfolio 2.0](/projects/portfolio-2.0). But it taught me the basics of any modern web framework, so I am grateful for it. It includes projects and blogs from back in 2023, but has not been updated since.

## Technologies used
- Vue.js
