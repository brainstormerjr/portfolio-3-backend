# Summary
My submission to the GMTK Game Jam 2023. Had was busy on the first day and had a fucked sleep schedule, so I woke up at noon on the second day to start working on the game. Kept the scope of the game small to make sure it was achievable within 12 hours, and it worked like a charm. One of the tightest deadlines (less than 24h) I have ever worked on, but still a very nice and polished game (and completed with a lot of time to spare).
