# Summary
The product I helped develop at my first software development internship, and my first opportunity to learn Flutter/Dart. Sadly, the entire project is closed-source and I signed an NDA, so I cannot share the source code for the project and the website.

But you can still visit the website at the link! I was in charge of the [landing page](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-6), and helped with some frontend design for the app. I also helped a little with backend, so I guess I got to do a little bit of everything.
