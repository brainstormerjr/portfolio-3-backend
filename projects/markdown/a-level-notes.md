# Summary
A small website where I uploaded most of my hand-written notes for A Level and shared with people because I am a nice person. A JavaScript sketch grabs all the notes and puts them in an HTML table element. That's it. My notes are glorious though. Maybe I should monetize this and sell them instead of giving them out for free.

## Technologies used

- Vanilla Javascript
