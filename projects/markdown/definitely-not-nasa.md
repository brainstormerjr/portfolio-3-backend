# Summary
I was revising physics when I thought to myself: What if a website could tell me exactly how many donuts I needed to send something into space? So I spent the next few days making it happen. A website that will calculate the amount of fuel needed to send an object of a particular mass into deep space using the formula for escape velocity and kinetic energy. It also tells you how much it would cost. Fuels include coal, uranium, sugar, donuts, tiramisu, tennis balls and so on.
