# Summary
A minimax algorithm that will play tic tac toe against you. It isn't super fun, because tic tac toe is such a small game that it can see all the way to the end of the game and play perfectly, and the AI will never lose. If you play perfectly, you will never lose either. The game just ends in a draw every single time. Inspired by the Coding Train's project.
