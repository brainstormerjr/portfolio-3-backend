# Summary
My submission to the GMTK Game Jam 2022, and my fourth game jam submission. Also my first time working with an ACTUAL artist ([ogas.art](https://www.instagram.com/ogas.art/) on Instagram), as seen from the outstanding crossbow on the title screen. The tight deadline still proved to be challenging, but this time I managed my time better so I actually got a working web build to upload, which is an improvement I guess.
