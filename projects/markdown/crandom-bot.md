# Summary
A discord bot that I made because I was in quarantine and was bored. It uses Node.js, Discord.js and Riot's Data Dragon.

Its main purpose is to generate a random loadout for League of Legends when someone types 'crandom', but it also has some other functionality such as checking a champion's abilities, throwing snowballs at people (virutally of course), getting a definition for a word, and an experimental feature of playing music in a voice channel. Yes these features are very random.

The problem? I don't have a server, and most hosting services cost money. So it is only online when I tell it to go online. Not very useful.

I followed the Coding Train's tutorial on Discord bots.
