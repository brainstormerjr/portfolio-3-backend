# Summary
My submission to the GMTK Game Jam 2021, and my second game jam game. I only had 2 days to make this game, so the tight time restriction plus terrible time management led to this project being one of my greatest failures. Without enough time to check out the built game, I realised that the game didn't run well on the web and it led to a terrible experience (it ran at about 0.5 frames per second). At least it was a good learning opportunity.
