# Summary
A personality test that me and my roomate came up with: classifying people as different mathematical functions. There are 11 pesonality types, and each of the 10 questions will add/subtract points from each personality depending on which options you choose.

The idea is extremely dumb, but I am proud of it nonetheless. It was also an interesting experience, trying to find and weigh questions to balance out different personalities. Maybe if I had a psych degree this would be even more accurate than it already is.
