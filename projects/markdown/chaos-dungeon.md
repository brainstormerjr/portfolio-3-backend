# Summary
My submission to the Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2, and my third and most successful game jam game. With more game-making experience and a looser time restriction, I was able to polish the game and test it to ensure that people playing my game had the best time possible.

All my effort paid off, as I managed to rank #19 in the 'fun' category and #24 in graphics, out of over 1700 entries.
