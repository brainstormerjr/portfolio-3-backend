# Summary
A simulator thing? Some sketch that will render the 'toothpick sequence' using P5. I learnt about this sequence on Numberphile and saw the Coding Train do it and I knew I just HAD to make a simulator myself. It can step through each iteration by itself, but becomes slow when there is just too much to render.
