# Summary
Don't let the name of the project fool you. This project consists of very little OSDev, and consists of a lot of web design.

A troll open-source operating system with a very serious website. Originally just an experiment to learn about operating systems, but after discovering that I know absolutely nothing about OSDev, I decided to make a website to advertise the operating system and a YouTube video followed. The video has way too many views.
